# GitHub Pages Setup for Playwright Reports

## What's Been Created

1. **GitHub Actions Workflow** (`.github/workflows/playwright.yml`)
   - Runs Playwright tests on push to `main` or `jsonplaceholder-and-automation-website-task` branches
   - Runs on pull requests to `main`
   - Can be manually triggered via workflow_dispatch
   - Deploys HTML reports to GitHub Pages (only from `main` branch)

2. **Generated Files**
   - `package-lock.json` - for npm dependency management

## How to Enable GitHub Pages

To display your Playwright reports, you need to enable GitHub Pages in your repository:

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click on **Settings** tab
3. Scroll down to **Pages** in the left sidebar
4. Under **Build and deployment**:
   - Source: Select **GitHub Actions**
5. Save the changes

## How It Works

### Test Execution
- Tests run in a Playwright Docker container for consistency
- Uses Node.js 20
- Installs dependencies via `npm ci`
- Runs all Playwright tests with `npx playwright test`

### Report Generation
- HTML report is automatically generated by Playwright (configured in `playwright.config.ts`)
- Additional reports (JSON, JUnit) are stored as artifacts

### Deployment
- The `deploy` job only runs after tests complete (success or failure)
- Only deploys from the `main` branch
- Uploads the HTML report to GitHub Pages
- Report is accessible via: `https://<username>.github.io/<repository-name>/`

## Viewing Reports

Once GitHub Pages is enabled and a workflow runs:
- Your report will be available at: `https://<username>.github.io/<repository-name>/`
- Each workflow run updates the report
- Only the latest report from `main` branch is shown

## Testing the Workflow

To trigger the workflow:

```bash
# Commit and push your changes
git add .
git commit -m "Add Playwright workflow and GitHub Pages setup"
git push origin jsonplaceholder-and-automation-website-task

# Or merge to main to trigger deployment
```

## Artifacts

Even if you're not on the `main` branch, test artifacts are saved for 30 days:
- `playwright-report` - HTML report with traces, screenshots, videos
- `test-reports` - JSON and JUnit XML reports

You can download these from the Actions tab in GitHub.
